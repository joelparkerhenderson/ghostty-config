# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# This template file has been automatically created at the following
# path since Ghostty couldn't find any existing config files on your system:
#
#   /Users/jph/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config
#
# The template does not set any default options, since Ghostty ships
# with sensible defaults for all options. Users should only need to set
# options that they want to change from the default.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.
#
# Ghostty can reload the configuration while running by using the menu
# options or the bound key (default: Command + Shift + comma on macOS and
# Control + Shift + comma on other platforms). Not all config options can be
# reloaded while running; some only apply to new windows and others may require
# a full restart to take effect.

# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
# # separated by equals signs.
# font-family = Iosevka
# window-padding-x = 2
#
# # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
# # All of these are identical:
# key=value
# key= value
# key =value
# key = value
#
# # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
# # a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a
# # part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
# background = #123abc
#
# # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.
# key =
#
# # Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value,
# # which is explained in the docs for that config option.
# # Just for example:
# resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms

### Visuals

theme = light:joelparkerhenderson-light,dark:joelparkerhenderson-dark

# window-theme controls the theme/appearance of the window decorations
# (titlebar, borders) - separate from the terminal color theme Ghostty.
window-theme = system

macos-titlebar-style = tabs
unfocused-split-opacity = 0.6
window-padding-x = 10
window-padding-y = 10

### Font

# I prefer IosevkaTerm Nerd Font Mono because it's narrow-width with glyphs.
# For more about config help for fonts, see the file config-help-fonts.md

font-family = IosevkaTerm Nerd Font Mono
font-size = 12

# Ghostty doesn’t support specifying font weight; it offers synthetic bolding.
# The font-thicken option (macOS only) artificially adds stroke weight.
# The font-thicken-strength parameter (0-255) lets you set how much.
# <https://nohzafk.github.io/posts/2025-12-04-configing-ghostty-to-match-wezterm/>

font-thicken = true
font-thicken-strength = 150

# Text in Ghostty appears more spread out horizontally due to roughly 1 pixel.
# To fix this wide letter spacing, we tighten the horizontal cell width by 5%.
# <https://nohzafk.github.io/posts/2025-12-04-configing-ghostty-to-match-wezterm/>

adjust-cell-width = -5%

# To disable programming ligatures, use -calt since this is the typical
# feature name for programming ligatures. To look into what font features your
# font has and what they do, use a font inspection tool such as fontdrop.info.
# To generally disable most ligatures, use -calt, -liga, -dlig.

### UX

# scrollback-limit in bytes, roughly 125,000 lines

### Shell integration

# note: see zsh/.zshrc "ghostty integration"

### Fix macOS color saturation

# On macOS systems, color saturation looks faded, like viewing it through fog.
# Ghostty defaults to sRGB, but on macOS displays, display-p3 looks better.
# <https://nohzafk.github.io/posts/2025-12-04-configing-ghostty-to-match-wezterm/>

# window-colorspace = srgb
window-colorspace = display-p3

### Keybindings

# super==cmd, alt==opt

# move between tabs is cmd+alt+arrow
keybind = super+alt+left=previous_tab
keybind = super+alt+right=next_tab

# move between panes is cmd+arrow
keybind = super+left=goto_split:previous
keybind = super+right=goto_split:next

# cmd+s sends :w<enter> - so cmd-s works in vim in terminal
keybind = super+s=text:\x1b:w\n
